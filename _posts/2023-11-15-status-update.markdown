I put together a subdomain for my resume.

Work in progress but here's my [resume](https://resume.barrymister.com/).

Also, had a breakthrough on soemthing very challenging today.

Something I've been working very hard on and didn't know if I could figure it out.

Feels good.

I haven't been able to dedicate any time to my other ventures.

Still trying to develop my business [Data Craftworks, LLC](https://datacraftworks.com/).

Trying to shore up the necessary administrative functions of both the LLC and the S corp I'm forming.

It's a lot. So much red tape and procedural work that has to be done to build a legit business.

But, I am loving it.
