I've been thinking back to the begining of my career. At the time I don't thinkg I realized what I would be doing professionally. I just wanted to do what I enjoyed. I wasn't thinking about making a living or marketable skills. I just know that building tiny websites with html and css was fun. I wasn't really very good at it, i was just tinkinering. At some point along the way I did try to turn my focus towards building web development into a business. This was mid-late 90s. I was still a philosophy student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and working as a News Editor for the student publication The Kaleidoscope. I remember some of the tools sued, Quark Express all MacIntosh pcs and servers. We used a paper board for the layout to model before entering into the editor. That is what went to print. I devlivered the papers as well. I wasn't very reliable at any of these responsibiitied. But, the thing I enjoyed was building the pages that were posted on the web version of the paper.
