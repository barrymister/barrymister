# Where it started
  I've been thinking back to the begining of my career. At the time I don't thinkg I realized what I would be doing professionally. I just wanted to do what I enjoyed. I wasn't thinking about making a living or marketable skills. I just know that building tiny websites with html and css was fun. I wasn't really very good at it, i was just tinkinering. At some point along the way I did try to turn my focus towards building web development into a business. This was mid-late 90s. I was still a philosophy student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and working as a News Editor for the student publication The Kaleidoscope. I remember some of the tools sued, Quark Express all MacIntosh pcs and servers. We used a paper board for the layout to model before entering into the editor. That is what went to print. I devlivered the papers as well. I wasn't very reliable at any of these responsibiitied. But, the thing I enjoyed was building the pages that were posted on the web version of the paper.

# Moving along
  I didn't stick with web deveolpment. Who knows what could have been. There have been times over the years that I have dabbled a bit here and there both at work and home for various purposes, self hosted blogs or inner office wikis. But, my journey took me down the SysOps path. A truly reqarding career full of opportunities to sandbox and build and tinker with all the new hardware and tech that has come along over the last 25 years in this vast information technology ocean. I've built massive stroage systems, robotic tape libraries, virtual clusters, hyperconverged solutions all so much fun, hard work, but exciting. There's a dark side as well. I've consoidated a lot of people out of work, including myself. Those layoffs post vmware adoption, entire server rooms scaled down to one rack. Great job, we won't be needing your services any longer. Workforce reduction. It was meant to be though, always something better, something new at the next stop. Well, not always. There were a couple moves along that way that felt like time travel to the past. Operating systems 10 years past EoL. Patches so far out of date there was no incremental upgrade path.
